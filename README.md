## Personal Portfolio

# Description: 

At the start of 2020, I challenged myself to create at least 6 different projects by the end of the year to learn and grow as a software engineer. The first project is this portfolio to help showcase my accomplishment during my career as an engineer. Test Driven Development was used on critical components in this project and are tested from the Travis CI pipeline.
